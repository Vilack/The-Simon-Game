# The-Simon-Game
A classic memory-based color sequence game built by implementing HTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery). 


## ABOUT THE GAME

This is a web-based implementation of the timeless Simon Game, where players test their memory skills by repeating an increasingly difficult sequence of flashing colors and sounds. With each new round, the game adds a new signal to the sequence, challenging the player to remember and repeat the entire pattern.

This game is created using colorful interactive UI. I have used Red, Blue, Green and Yellow.
